title: "Leveraging ChatGPT API for Enhanced Data
Preprocessing in NatUKE"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This scientific paper presents an approach for enhancing the performance of machine learning models by
utilizing ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, for data preprocessing. The
study focuses on the existing Project NatUKE (A Benchmark for Natural Product Knowledge Extraction
from Academic Literature) and investigates the impact of incorporating ChatGPT in the preprocessing
pipeline. By leveraging the natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT, we aim to improve the
quality and relevance of the data used as input for the knowledge graph embedding algorithms. This
paper provides a detailed description of the methodology employed, the experimental setup, and the
results obtained, highlighting the benefits and limitations of this approach.'
